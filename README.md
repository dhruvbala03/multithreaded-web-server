**HTTP Server in C**

This project implements a HTTP server using TCP sockets in C. The server handles incoming HTTP requests, serves static files from a specified directory. 
Part 1 contains a single threaded implmentation, while the implementation in Part 2 supports concurrent client connections through a thread-safe connection queue.
